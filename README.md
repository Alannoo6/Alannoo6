## About Me

Data Analyst specialized in business-oriented analytics, data visualization, and process automation to support data-driven decision making.

I hold a degree in Business Administration and have over three years of experience optimizing commercial and operational processes at Brandteam Group. I have designed and implemented more than 15 Power BI dashboards that reduced reporting time by 60% (from 8 hours to 3 hours per week).

My background combines strong business knowledge with technical expertise in SQL Server, Power BI, DAX and Python. I focus on translating complex business requirements into analytical solutions that generate actionable insights and measurable impact.

I have developed automated processes using SQL Server for data extraction and transformation, and Python for task automation including report generation, email distribution and file processing.

Currently building my career with a strong focus on data engineering, analytics automation and scalable BI solutions.
